## **Car Price Prediction**

Dataset : Car Details Dataset.

Steps

Packeges Required.

  + Pandas
  + Numpy
  + Matplotlib.
  + Seaborn
  + sklearn
  + linear regression module
  + MSE and R2 score metrics

      
Data Wrangling : Initial Data Analysis

  + Handling Missing Data.
  + Correct the Data Format.
  + Data Standardization.
  + Data Normalization.
  
Exploratory Data Analysis.

  + Analysing Individual features using data visualization.
  + Checking the Correlations of the Datapoints.
  + Checking for Continuous Numerical Variables and Categorical Variables.
  + Finding the Positive and Negatively Correlated Variables towards the Price.
  + Using the Regression Plots for Continous Numerical variables and Boxplots for Categorical Variables.
  + Get the Value Counts of Categorical Data Points to Understand the Data is Distributed in a way that it will act as a Price Estimator.
  + Pearsons Correlation Theory and Practice.
  + ANOVA method.
  + Finally getting the most important variables that will affect the price of the car.

Model Development

  + Develop the Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression Models.
  + Visualize the best fits to the Models.
  + Compute the r2-square and MSE values for the model.
  + Decide which model is better to predict the Car Price by Comparing the MSE and R2 values for different Models.
